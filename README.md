# Mini-Wikipedia
As the title seem, 
this is a smaller version of wikipedia,
where there's an encyclopedia and a search input, 
where all the informations about ceratin topics/words are stored,
if u find a False information concerning a certain topic,
you can edit it, update it and then publish the new version of it,
you can also publish a new information concerning a specific topic, by clicking on Create New Page,
let's not forget the fact that you can randomise the informations you are looking at,
to absorb more knowledge of topics you may have never heard of.
